# Hello world!

`hello-world` is a full Kotlin implementation of a 'Hello world!' app with increasing complexity. 

## The stack 

The final app is a multiplatform build with a RESTful API that runs on JVM, a persistence layer on PostgreSQL, and a Kotlin/React frontend. 

## The stages

The app starts off by being an incredibly simplistic CLI that does exactly what it says on the label: it prints 'Hello world!'. Then, we complicate it by adding multiple languages, randomness, a database layer with migrations, an API layer and finally a frontend:

1. `Hello world!`
2. `Hello world!` in a random language
3. `Hello world!` via HTTP
4. `Hello world!` from a database
5. `Hello world!` via a REST API
6. `Hello world!` on an app

## The reason behind

This project was prepared as a thought experiment for an introductory course on Kotlin. It incorporates some of the more common language features, a handful of common testing practices, and a number of the most frequently used libraries - like `ktor` and `exposed`. 

## Contributions

Please keep in mind that this app is not intended for any sort of production use. That said, if you feel that there is some improvement in terms of common practice, new developments or additional concepts, please feel free to submit a PR or fork this project entirely.
